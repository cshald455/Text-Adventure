    <p> Your mission is to slay the dragon king and free the elves from his reign of terror.
    The Dragon King took control of the elves nine years ago, and has been a very ruthless dictator,
    killing those who get in his way, and forcing everyone else into labor. People have tried to stand up to him in the past,
    but no one has even come close to beating him. Nobody is sure what his goals are or why he does this. Perhaps he's using the
    elves for something, or he just has an insatiable lust for power. Whatever the reason, he has to be stopped. Go kill him. </p>
